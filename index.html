              <p class="lead">A fun, active, hands on approach to
              encouraging kids to explore photography. We’re going to
              build on the experiences of previous years and mix other
              media with our digital photography. This workshop has
              been designed for children from ages five to twelve;
              from those who already own/use a digital camera to those
              who have absolutely no experience. It will even be
              rewarding for children who have previously preferred
              painting, drawing and have no photographic
              experience.</p>

      <div class="featurette">
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">What do we do? <span class="muted">It'll blow your mind.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">We cover everything, from the basics on how to
        treat your camera, and ensuring that everyone knows how it
        works, to composition, training ourselves to notice the best
        shot and capturing subjects from various viewpoints. We'll
        have "treasure hunt" photo-walks, shoot portraits, landscapes
        and environmental art. We'll use sunshine to print photographs
        on to wood. We'll even discover some of the stranger stories
        from the history of photography and learn some basic photo
        processing. We learn to make pinhole cameras, and turn a house
        into a camera obscura. There are around four children to a
        group. Keeping the workshop size small means that everyone
        gets plenty of individual attention.
        </p>

      <div class="featurette">
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">What do you bring? <span class="muted">Enthusiasm Creativity.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Child’s own digital camera or borrow mum or
        dad’s camera (compact point and shoot, or DSLR),
        an <b>empty</b> memory card, (we don’t want to start out
        sorting through all your old holiday pictures, and you don’t
        want that either) a fully charged camera battery. We have a
        limited number of cameras that children can borrow for the
        workshop if they forget their own, however it is preferable
        that they do bring their own, for continuity over all
        sessions.Everyone will have a get an opportunity to use a DSLR
        camera during the week. If you're staying for a full day bring
        lunch too.
        </p>

      <div class="featurette">
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">What do you take home? </h2>

        pieces, including a 8x8 or 8x10 solar ink print on wood.The
        confidence that you are the most knowledgable and skilled
        photographer in the family.</p>
